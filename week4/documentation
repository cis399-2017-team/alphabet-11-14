For this assignment I used all three instances for load balancing.
When all three are shut off, the page is never loaded. (Does the request finish?)

When one is active, all traffic is routed to the single instance, otherwise it is random.
Restoring instances causes a brief wati until the next health check for the load balancer to route traffic to instances running apache.

I made a directory pupppet:///modules/apache2/html/ and set recurse true associating it with /var/www/html/, replicating the same index.html across all agents.
